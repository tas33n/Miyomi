## 🌟 Why Miyomi (Benefits for the Community)

### ✅ Easier discovery for everyone
Instead of scattered posts across different platforms, Miyomi keeps apps/extensions/resources organized in one searchable place.

### 🔎 Better structure (tags, types, platforms)
Entries can include metadata like supported platforms, content types (Manga/Anime/Light Novel), tags, links, and compatibility.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community-curated
The directory is powered by community contributions. If something is missing or outdated, you can help fix it.

### 🛡️ Safer updates (review/moderation)
v3 supports a moderation workflow so updates can be reviewed before being published (reduces spam and broken links).
